     <p style="font-size:20px">"But in order that you may see whence comes all this born error of those who accuse pleasure and praise pain, I will open the whole thing, and explain the very things which were said by that discoverer of truth and, as it were, the architect of a happy life. great pains follow those who do not know how to pursue pleasure. Nor is there anyone who wants to pursue pain because it is pain, but because such times never occur that he seeks some great pleasure through labor and pain , who of us undertakes any physical exercise, except in order to derive some benefit from it? But who can rightly blame him who wants to be in that pleasure without any discomfort, or him who avoids pain from which no pleasure is produced?"</p>
